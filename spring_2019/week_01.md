## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week we worked on the survey and I completed the header and footer section of the survey. I also did some research into different links into different resources and methods for support for people who are looking for help.

## This Week's Plan

> This week we plan on creating an object oriented implementation of the survey, which will likely require a reimplementation of my header/footer code. I also plan on finishing the first iteration of the resource page.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am still very much in the process of learning iOS development, however my group member is making the learning process much easier as he is very experienced with Swift. 

## Notes

> I am going to look into people who I can reach out to in order to design a more user-friendly UI and UX, as well as someone who is a graphic designer to maybe design an icon or some of the resources for the app.
