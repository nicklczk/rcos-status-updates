## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week we made our presntation and gave our presentation to the small group. It went pretty well, however I think we need to work on making our slides more readable and less boring. I also am working on the more resources page but at this point, I think that I wont really have time to get a fully functional page with interactive links before presentation time. I also have gone through a few iterations of our logo and have settled on a logo and have pushed that change. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week we are going to present our changes work and our somewhat finished product and then take the comments that we get from that and figure out where we go from there over the summer to make this a finished product. 

## Anything Blocking?

> SD&D project deadlines are killing me, so I havnt gotten as much done as I would like but Im still really happy with the state of our app. 

## Notes

> With the semester coming to an end, even though I did not do as much as I would have liked, Im still really happy with how our project ended up.
