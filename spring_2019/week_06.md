## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I worked on the more resources page, but Im having a problem with the indentation and the constraints. I plan on talking to Zach and asking for advice on how to fix these issues. We also took a look at Zach's usage of the charts API and it looks good, we need to take a look at how the bounding boxes are made and how the graphs are displayed but Im going to let Zach take care of that since he knows a lot more about it than I do. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan on getting the more resources page fully functional so that I have something to show to the CGCD's design team so that I can get some tips on how to improve the user experience.

## Anything Blocking?

> I scheduled the meeting with the Center pretty late into the semester and am probbaly not going to have enough time with tests coming up to actually make any changes, but it should be important for figuring out what our next steps are moving forward before putting this live on the app store.
