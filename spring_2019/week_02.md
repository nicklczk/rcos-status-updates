## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week we focused on the survey. We started by deciding to go with a table view with a header and footer section. Right now our plan is to hard code it into the storyboard. I have also looked into an alternative for the Beck's Depression Index as I have found out that it is copyrighted. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week we will continue to work on creating an object oriented version of the survey so that we can later add more tests if necissary. I have also found the PHQ-9 and will look at how this will change our plans.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am still learning whatever I can from my group member about iOS development as I am still very new to this.
