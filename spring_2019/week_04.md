## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I didnt get mich done as I have been busy with midterms but I have received some information on what I should put on the more resources pages. I also talked to Zach about the dependecies manager that we should use and we agreed on CocoaPods as Zach is more familiar with it. We also decided on using charts as our open sources data vizualisation library. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan on working on the disclaimer page and the more resources page. I need to write something for the disclaimer and figure out how to have a scroll view and a button at the bottom which then leads the user to the survey page. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I have a lot of assignments due this week, so I'm probably going to work on all of this stuff during Spring Break.
