## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Zach has been making strides with the line graph, allowing for it to be smoothed out and look pretty good. He's also adding a settings page where we can add more things as necissary. I also met with the UI team and showed them our app. They made some comments on how our app looks pretty boring but that it is usable and effective which, for a medical app, is effective. They also told me that hte more resources page should have clickable links and buttons rather than a "wall of text," which I guess is fair. 
## This Week's Plan

> Taking the CGCD's advice Im going to look into working on the more resources page and including buttons and hyperlinks rather than just a wall of text that it is tonight. I also talked to them about a logo design and have worked a little bit on that. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I only have a few weeks to get all of these things done before presentation time, and I have an exam and a bunch of other projects and assignments that I need to get done before I can work on this app. So I am content with the current state of the more resources page but we'll see.
