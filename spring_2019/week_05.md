## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Over the break and this week I managed to fill out the disclaimer page and refined the survey a little bit to make it more object oriented, so that, if we want to include other surveys we can easily allow the user to include other tests for anxiety, anxiety and depression, or just depression. I also resized the questions on the storyboard so that theyre a little easier to look at. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week I want to work on the more resources page since I've written up a script for what I want to include in it and now that I know how to make a scrollable view in the storyboard. And as we are getting most of the way there in terms of how things are going to look I also have set up a meeting time with the Center for Global Communication and Design's design team to ask them what we can do to improve the UX and UI of the app.
