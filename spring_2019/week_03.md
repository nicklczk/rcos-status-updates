## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week we got the survey table working, however we are working on reading and writing the data to iOS's defualt databasing system, Core Data. Right now Zach has implemented a way to print the data from the database to the console, so that we know that the data is being saved so that w can later display it with data vizualization. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan on putting in the PHQ-9 into our table view. I have compiled and made the questions more concise so that they fit better on smaller iPhones. I will also work on the more resources page. I dont have any content for it yet and have reached out to a friend who is training to be a therapist for good resources and am waiting to hear back from her. Right now I'm plannnig on just getting a tempalate for More resources working. 

## Anything Blocking?

> Midterms are coming up and thats gonna slow down devleopment. Im also still learning the different views and how they need to be contianed in the storyboard. I need to figure out how to make a scrollable view for the more resources page and will ask Zach for help on that.
