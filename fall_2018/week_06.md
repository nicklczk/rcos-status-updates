## Last Week's Accomplishments

I started playing around with doing autocomplete fields for authors as well as kickers. It's going to be a little different since currently we oull from the authors page but I think that it's the right thing to do in the end. I also got a nice looking EdOp page that I'm happy with.

## This Week's Plan

I need to think of how we want features and news presets to look. I also think I'm going to play around with interview templates in which we can throw up the audio recordings or little snippets or pull quotes. 

## Anything Blocking?

Im not really sure how we want to do anything different from the core template for articles when it comes to features and news. I'm thinking that news woud allow for support of pull quotes but that might be a little out of the scope for the MVP that we need by the start of the spring semester.
