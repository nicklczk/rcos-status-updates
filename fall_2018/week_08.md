## Last Week's Accomplishments

All I did this week was update the HTML in my edop article subtype to take an "about the author" section. It works and looks good but I still need to figure out a way to set the subpage_type in the admin panel. 

## This Week's Plan

I plan on creating a section in the edop article admin panel that allows for a user to specify "about the author." Once I do that I need to create a panel which allows you select the subpage_type.

## Anything Blocking?

Im having a hard time figuring out if I want to have the article type determined in the index or in the article itself. I think that the article makes the most sense right now but I need to check in with Sid.
