## Last Week's Accomplishments

I started working on templates for different sections which might want to display content in a specific way. For eaxmple, on the EdOp template I created a field for photos of the writers as well as making the author name and position more prominent on the page. I also started playing around with autocomplete fields for things like kickers. 

## This Week's Plan

I want to finish up working on the templates for Edop, features, and autocompleting fields for kickers

## Anything Blocking?

The issues that I have had this week were mainly with figuring out how we want certain templates to look and how they differ from the generic article. I was also having issues with creating an autocomplete field for snipppet types because its a lot easier to do it for pages_types, although I found some documentation for doing the autocomplete field for snippets so I should be able to figure it out.
