## Last Week's Accomplishments

So I made a pull request on my documentation changes, waiting on approval to merge that into main. I checked a bunch of changes Sid made and apporoved them. I started to play around with syndication in Django but found out that Sid is already pretty much done that aspect so I'm gonna focus on the comics page thing now.

## This Week's Plan

Get a working comics page up as it's own branch. Then looking in the future I can figure out how to autogenerate crosswords, sudoku, comics, etc. on the page

## Anything Blocking?

Right now the only thing blocking me is my inexperience with django and Wagtail.
