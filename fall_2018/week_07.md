## Last Week's Accomplishments

I found a bunch of issues with my autocomplete code and then fixed it and now it works and is merged into master. I reviewed a bunch of PRs to get Pipeline up to date. I also finally figured out how I want to have our edop section to look and wrote up the HTML for it. I also figured out that for the models you can inherit and add whatever fields you need to create a new model, so Im doing that for EdOp since we need what I'm calling a blurb which gives some context for the author in the article.

## This Week's Plan

Gonna flesh out blurbs and finish up the EdOp template. Once I get that working I still ahve a bunch of stuff on my personal todo list including: Image galleries, Comics pages with generated sudoku and word searches, slug automatically being created, and Poly Snaps. 

## Anything Blocking?

Still learning how to create custom fields for templates.
