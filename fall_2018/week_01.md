## Last Week's Accomplishments

I pushed a change to the documentation updates that I made last week to a documentation branch and did a clean install of Pipeline on a new machine following those instructions to see if it was comprehensive and it worked. I also started to look at syndication and the search function features on the site and looked at some of the things that I need to do to improove them. I also started to think about how we want to make the comics page, and whether or not we even want to have a comics page. I also played around with the website's admin page and found some quality of life changes that we could make for editors.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on sitting down with Sid and getting a better idea of how everything works and then starting getting some work done on an issue. I also want to talk to him about how to optimize the admin page for our future users.

## Anything Blocking?

Right now I'm still familiarizing myself with how pipeline is organized since I have never done any work with Django.
