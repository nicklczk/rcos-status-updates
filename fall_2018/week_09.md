## Last Week's Accomplishments

I worked on creating a field for the EDOP about the author section in the admin panel of the article. Right now I just did that for every article for testing purposes since I havn't been able to figure out how to select from different templates in the article. I still havnt been able to figure out how I want to do the selection of the article subtype.

## This Week's Plan

This week Im planning on fully implementing the EDOP article subtype as well as work on the presentation. I still don't really know how I want to do it yet but I have inheritance figured out based off it's parent's type. Im going to talk to Sid about the best way to set this up and try to figure out where to go from there but I know that Im going to have to create a drop down menu somewhere which allows you to determine an article's type.

## Anything Blocking?

I dont really know where to put the dropdown which lets you choose the article's type. I've been operating under the assumption that I could just determine if the parent node's name is EDOP and then if that's the case then I could overide the article subtype and use the EDOP subtype but I talked to Sid about that and I don't think that would work because then if we wanted to change the section name on the website or something like that then it would break every article.
