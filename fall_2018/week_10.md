## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I implemented full functionality for the Edop section code. Now that I finished that feature setup in addition to autocompleted fields I have accomplished what I wanted to get done this semester. 

## This Week's Plan

Over the break I'm going to pull request my code in once I integrate it with the current master branch since my branch is a couple commits behind.
