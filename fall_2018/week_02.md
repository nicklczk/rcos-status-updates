## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I noticed that the documentation for installation wasn't entirely complete, so I changed it a little bit. All I have to do now is do a pull request.

## This Week's Plan

Talk to Pragati and Sid about how we are going to approve pulls and then start working on the comics page for the website.

## Anything Blocking?

I've been reallyt busy with midterms, but they're all done now so hopefully I'll be able to get some more substantial work done.
