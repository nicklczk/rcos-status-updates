## Last Week's Accomplishments

I started a template for comics page, right now its the bearest of bones because I'm still getting familiar with wagtail. I also wanted to figure out what I want to do before so I created a list of things, this includes:
	1. Comics page
	2. generating sudoku and word searches as HTML and make them a type to put on the comics page
	3. Different article format types (ie. Ed/Op, News, interviews, etc.)
	4. slug autocomplete
THe comics page is going to be a bigger project, whereas I think that the format types, and slug autocompleter are little things that I can get done when I get sick of working on comics.

## This Week's Plan

I need to flesh out the comics page and figure out how to generate content for it. then push the changes for review. 

## Anything Blocking?

Right now the only thing blocking me is my inexperience with django and Wagtail.
